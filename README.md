# Video Chat App

This is my first video chat app project for android platforms after learning flutter & dart development on Udemy.
I decided to make this open source to show my coding skills :)

Some of it is learned from the course. However, this time I am doing it on all my own and using documentations available on website.

## APIs involved

- [Auth Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
- [Firestore Cloud (Also Firebase Product)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- [Agora SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/)

### This project is WIP, not a finished product. Please bear with me if there is any problems with this app.
