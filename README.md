# Video Chat App

This is my first video chat app project for android platforms after learning flutter & dart development on Udemy.
I decided to make this open source to show my coding skills :)

Some of it is learned from the course. However, this time I am doing it on all my own and using documentations available on website.

## APIs/Backend that don't exist in this repository:

- [Video Chat App API Server](https://github.com/yoelbuzgalo/video-chat-test-api-server) via HTTP request
- [Agora SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/) - WIP

### This project is WIP, not a finished product. Please bear with me if there is any problems with this app.
